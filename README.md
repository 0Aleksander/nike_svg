# Nike Logo Simulation using Bezier Curves in SVG

This project is my second project falling under the class NSA4 it simulates the Nike logo using Bezier curves in an HTML5 document with the `<svg>` element. The logo is drawn using the `bezierCurveTo` function in JavaScript, and the curve points are derived from an image of the Nike logo processed in GIMP.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create an SVG representation of the Nike logo by utilizing the power of Bezier curves. The process involves:
- Loading the Nike logo image into GIMP.
- Tracing the logo using Bezier curves.
- Extracting the curve points from GIMP and using those points to draw the logo in HTML using the `<svg>` tag and `bezierCurveTo` function.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the SVG code and JavaScript for rendering the logo.
- `styles.css`: (Optional) CSS file to style the page (if necessary).
- `nike-logo.svg`: The SVG file with the Nike logo representation (if you decide to separate the SVG into a standalone file).
- `nike-logo.png`: (Optional) The original Nike logo image used for tracing.
